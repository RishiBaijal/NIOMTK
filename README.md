NIOMTK
This contains the code for a Non-Intrusive Occupancy Monitoring Toolkit that I will be building as part of my B.Tech Project.

AIM
---

The aim is to develop a system that uses a non-intrusive approach to predict occupancy of a given home in a given dataset.
In order to do this, we will be looking at the following datasets: 
1. REDD
2. AMPDs
3. COMBED

We will also be looking at atleast three different algorithms in order to solve this problem. The details of these will be decided later. As the project progresses, I will update the repository with the respective files.
